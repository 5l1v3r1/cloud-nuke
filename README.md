# aws-nuke

This repo contains a CLI tool to delete all AWS resources in an account. aws-nuke was created for situations when you might have an account you use for testing and need to clean up left over resources so AWS doesn't charge you for them. Also great for cleaning out accounts with redundant resources.

The currently supported functionality includes:

* Deleting all unprotected EC2 instances in an AWS account

### WARNING: THIS TOOL IS HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE, ALL SUPPORTED RESOURCES WILL BE DELETED. IT'S EFFECTS ARE IRREVERSIBLE AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT

## Install

1. Download the latest binary for your OS on the [releases page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/aws-nuke/releases).
2. Move the binary to a folder on your `PATH`. E.g.: `mv gruntwork_darwin_amd64 /usr/local/bin/aws-nuke`.
3. Add execute permissions to the binary. E.g.: `chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/aws-nuke`.
4. Test it installed correctly: `aws-nuke --help`.
